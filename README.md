## Credit

This repository contains exercises and examples inspired by the course  
"HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers" by Professor Yaakov Chaikin (Johns Hopkins University).

All instructional credit goes to the course instructor.  
The implementations here reflect my personal learning and practice.
